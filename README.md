## Impressionist Painter

### Introduction

This is a basic painting app that allows the user to paint in an impressionist style by sampling from a loaded image and painting the same image using varying brush styles, opacities, and sizes.  It was built with the android platform in mind, and more specifically geared towards the tablet format.  Functionality includes loading and saving images from the device gallery, clearing the current canvas, and undoing or redoing actions.  It's features include five different brush shapes, ability to change brush radius and opacity, and use a negative color filter.

### Motivation

The project was created as part of a university course.
